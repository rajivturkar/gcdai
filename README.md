* Install anaconda distribution
* Point your python and pip to /anaconda3/bin/python & /anaconda3/bin/pip respectively
* Run `python sup.py note pythondemo` OR `python sup.py project pythondemo`
* This will create a boiler plate folder structure and an `.ipynb` file inside `src` directory. You can create other python modules and packages in `src` directory. If you ran for `note`, then this will create a new notebook and open it up for you on the browser. In case the notebook was already there, it will just open it up on browser
* Play with `.ipynb` files in browser, and with python modules and packages in some IDE that provides good python syntax support, e.g. visual studio code, pycharm, etc.
* You can stop jupyter notebooks by `jupyter notebook stop <port number>`.
* You can start jupyter notebooks by `jupyter notebook`. The directory from where you run the command will become your home directory
